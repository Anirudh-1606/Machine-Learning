Purpose of Chat Bot:-
This Chat bot is mainly used to establish a communication from a Farmer who wants to sell his harvest crops to a Vegetable Vendor. Though this chat bot does several other things apart from the vendor option like awareness on organic farming, Farming tips and the world pandemic COVID-19 the chat bot prompts the user to give his name, crop, price, address and method of farming. The sole idea is to store this data and to notify the vendor to collect the crops from the farmer just via a chatbot application.
